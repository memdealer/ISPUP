# This is roughly designed "monitoring thing" for mikrotik' routers monitoring.

##### TODO:
- Add prometheus, just so I can export it to grafana and see when ISP or specific router was down
- Add asyncio support, as it is partialy async now, or let's say 10% 

##### If you desperate and want to try it too:
- Fill ISPup.env.vars, with BOT api key, add desired chat id in telegram to be notified in -
- Run build.sh
